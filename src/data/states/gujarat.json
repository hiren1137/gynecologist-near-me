I was fortunate to meet her at  someone else’s clinic, and since then, we have formed an unbreakable bond.\n\nSpeaking about my journey, I was RA positive, and Dr. Rinkal Patel has always given me strength. My case was very complicated, as I have been on medication for arthritis. Despite her busy schedule, she was always available 24/7 for me, understanding my condition and ensuring I received the best care possible.\n\nWhat sets Dr. Rinkal Patel apart is not just her medical expertise but also her compassionate and patient-friendly approach. She listens attentively, explains medical conditions in a simple and understandable manner, and always prioritizes her patients' well-being. Her dedication to her profession is truly inspiring, as she goes beyond just prescribing medicines—she provides emotional support, reassurance, and the motivation needed to fight through difficult times.\n\nHer professionalism, responsibility, and caring nature make her more than just a doctor—she is a true guardian of her patients' health. Whether it’s a late-night emergency or a moment of doubt, she never hesitates to guide and support her patients with empathy and kindness. We are truly grateful to have found such a dedicated and exceptional doctor.\nBecause of her guidance and support, I gave birth to a baby girl on February 3rd this year. I am deeply grateful to her from the bottom of my heart.",

Her perfection is accurate diagnosis (every time proven by test reports later), and effective treatment is seen at every step.

She is a great listener, answers all your questions, and spends enough time to make you feel safe and comfortable. She is very experienced, very hardworking, available 24x7 for her patients, and treats the patients with respect and kindness.\n\nI have also recommended one of my relatives for treatment of Endometrial cancer, and Dr. Riddhi Shah has confidently performed surgeries with all the advanced technology and treated her so well that she is out of danger and happy.\n\nI must say – She is a world-class doctor, she is marvellous!\n\nHighly recommended gynaecologist!",

Naturally, we were anxious. But from the very first consultation, the team at Naritva gave us hope for a normal delivery—and they delivered on that promise beautifully. The entire process was smooth and without any complications.\n\nWhat really sets Naritva apart is their genuine focus on natural birthing, which is rare to find these days. They are also equipped with advanced medical facilities, neonatologist doctors available on-site, and 24x7 emergency care, which gave us great peace of mind.\n\nA big thank you to Manthan Bhai, who guided us every step of the way with patience and clarity. The staff was extremely cooperative, humble, and professional, and the hospital rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable, which really made a difference during our stay.\n\nWe are truly grateful to the entire Naritva team for making this such a positive and memorable experience.

          "text": "My husband also wrote review and I am also writing it as a pregnant patient how I felt. Today was my first visit to this hospital as a pregnant patient, and what should have been a routine checkup turned into an upsetting experience.\n\nAfter my consultation, the doctor asked for blood and urine tests. I followed the instructions and collected my urine sample as requested. But when I returned with the clean, sealed container, I was told to place it under a table—right beside a dustbin. Later, when the lab technician arrived, I was asked to pick it up myself and hand it over.\n\nAs someone who is pregnant and already navigating the physical and emotional challenges that come with it, I was shocked. I expected care, compassion, and professionalism—what I experienced instead was disregard and a lack of basic support. Why should a pregnant patient be expected to bend down and retrieve a sample, especially when staff are present and capable?\n\nWhat hurt even more was the response I received when I brought this up with Dr. Dhara Patel. She told me that neither she nor her staff ever touch urine samples, as if that was completely normal. Honestly, I was stunned. Is this how patients—especially vulnerable ones—are treated here?\n\nThis may seem like a small incident to some, but it left me feeling disrespected and uncared for in a place where I had hoped to feel safe and supported. I truly hope the hospital takes this seriously and reflects on how patients, especially those expecting, are being treated.",

Dr. Pooja’s positivity and expert advice made each milestone pregnancy scan memorable and full of hope — and together, we accomplished a positive pregnancy.\n\nEach part of the journey was thoroughly explained— and Dr Pooja was more than happy to answer all our questions and smallest concerns. We looked forward to our appointments and interactions with her every few weeks.\nDoctor explained each part of the delivery process — asking for our consent at each step, eventually leading to a mutually agreeable delivery outcome. It made me very satisfied and happy that Dr Pooja did not dismiss my concerns, requests and birth plan — and accommodated to the best of her professional protocols.\nI will always remember Dr Pooja’s genuine happiness during the moment of my baby’s birth!\n\nAfter delivery, I didn’t feel like leaving the hospital— thanks to the love and care shown by each of the staff members.\n\nFrom junior doctors to sisters and cleaning staff, each person made our baby and me feel comfortable, heard and cared for. My post-op private room was regularly cleaned, and there was always staff available at the nurse station to help my family round the clock.\nOur visitors too were impressed with the cleanliness and smooth functioning of the hospital.\n\nVery thankful to Dr Pooja and team for making our pregnancy and delivery experience smooth, positive and full of joy!",

Sounds unbelievable, right?\n\nBut that’s exactly how my experience was at Jariwala Hospital. I recently had my C-section done there, and it turned out to be one of the most beautiful and memorable moments of my life. The entire birthing process was handled with such care and expertise that it truly felt magical.\n\nDr. Mahesh Jariwala is changing the narrative around childbirth—challenging the old stereotypes that natural birth is always better than a C-section. His calm approach, clinical precision, and empathetic care made me feel completely safe, informed, and supported throughout the journey.\n\nIf you ever thought C-sections had to be stressful or traumatic, Jariwala Hospital will prove otherwise. It’s not just a hospital—it’s a place where new life begins with joy, dignity, and compassion.",

          "text": "\"Dr. Mahesh Jariwala is undoubtedly one of the finest gynecologists and surgeons in Ahmedabad. His approach to patient care sets him apart from others in the field. When my wife was eight months pregnant, our previous doctor recommended an immediate cesarean delivery due to low amniotic fluid and the baby’s breech position. Understandably, this news left us unprepared and anxious. Fortunately, a friend referred us to Dr. Jariwala, and visiting his hospital turned out to be a game-changer.\n\nAfter a thorough evaluation, Dr. Jariwala reassured us that we could safely wait a week before proceeding with a Ligasure surgery—an advanced technique that proved to be highly effective. This method minimized pain for my wife, ensured a swift recovery, and resulted in remarkably low blood loss. The surgery itself was seamless and efficient. I even had the privilege of being on a video call with my wife during the procedure, witnessing the magical moment our baby was born live—an unforgettable and heartwarming experience.\n\nThe staff at Jariwala Hospital deserve equal praise. Their humility, kindness, and soft-spoken nature created an atmosphere that felt more like home than a hospital. Transparency is clearly a priority here, with all charges openly displayed on a board in the reception area, fostering trust and clarity for patients. The hospital itself is impeccably clean and well-maintained.\n\nOur experience was nothing short of extraordinary: we arrived at 11 AM, the surgery took place at 11:57 AM, and by 12:07 PM, I was holding our healthy baby in my arms. By 2:30 PM, my wife was already up, walking, and doing light exercises. We were discharged by 4:00 PM and back home by 6:00 PM that same day, with my wife mobile and our baby thriving. Now, 15 days later, both mother and baby are doing wonderfully, with a recovery that has been impressively swift.\n\nOverall, our time at Jariwala Hospital was exceptional. I wholeheartedly give Dr. Jariwala, his team, and the facility a 10/10. A truly superb experience!\"",

Vora on 9th April, 2025 at her clinic with a complaint of Heavy Menstrual and Abnormal Uterine Bleeding since last many years.  She immediately understood the problem and explained and suggested my wife to undergo Laproscopic Hysterectomy.  They way she explained the procedure and subsequent recovery etc. left us without an iota of doubt that we had come to the right place though it was recommended by my relative Padmaja Tripathi.  The operation was scheduled on 17th April 25 and discharge given on 18th evening. From the initial consultation to post operative care, their professionalism, expertise and compassionate approach were truly extraordinary. I want to extend my deepest gratitude for the exceptional care you provided to my wife during her laparoscopic hysterectomy. Your clear explanations and reassurance put our minds at ease, and your surgical skill ensured that my wife had a smooth procedure with minimal discomfort and a quick recovery. We are incredibly grateful for the kindness and dedication you and your team showed throughout this journey. Special thanks to Dr. Pragnesh Shah for his very comforting approach.  Thank you once again for everything you have done for my wife. We truly appreciate your hard work and commitment towards your patients.",

From our first appointment, she made me feel comfortable, listened to all my concerns, and explained everything in a way that was easy to understand. Her expertise and calm demeanor made a huge difference in reducing any anxiety I had during the process. The delivery itself went smoothly, and I felt incredibly supported every step of the way.

Their calm and reassuring manner immediately put me at ease and made me feel confident that I was in the best hands.\n\nThe laparoscopic approach was minimally invasive, which made the recovery much smoother than I expected. The post-surgery results have been truly life-changing—my pain has significantly reduced, and the discomfort I had been living with due to the endometriotic cysts has greatly improved.\n\nBoth doctors were attentive during follow-ups and made sure I was healing well, answering any questions I had with patience and care. Their dedication to patient well-being is truly commendable.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Nirav Patel and Dr. Kinnari Amin to anyone dealing with endometriosis or related gynecological issues.\n\nTheir expertise and compassionate approach made a challenging time much easier, and I am incredibly thankful for their support and skill.",

Earlier my case was with some other Gynecologist…but suddenly in the 7th month after I had heavy bleeding my case became critical…My weight was also very low and hemoglobin level had also gone down considerably. Along with this I had problem in breathing…and heartbeat became fast. Even after the 7th month I started having mild contractions. In 2-3 private hospitals my case was considered risky and I was referred to a Government Hospital. In this situation Bindu Ma’am took my case in hand from Bonita Gynec hospital.  And the way I was treated there from the 7th month onwards...I don't have words to express it. Bonita Ma'am treated me like a mother every time. Even the complete staff was supportive and caring. Be it day or night the Dr. and staff took complete care of us. Even whenever there was a need we were guided well on a call. It was very difficult that my pregnancy could reach the 9th month...but Ma'am's full support was there...and after one week was completed in the 9th month my cesarean was done....Even during the cesarean the support, care and behaviour of the staff there and especially Mehul Sir was incredible.  A healthy baby was delivered with great care and support. And discharge was done from there with great love. I would advise all of you to definitely visit the hospital once....Last but not the least.....Thank You so much to the entire staff of Bonita Gynec and Surgical Hospital.",

The whole team at work, including the brilliant doctors Dr. Parul, Dr. Sonal, Dr. Kanan, and the anesthetists, as well other members such as the receptionist, the nurses and cleaners was an impeccable one. But along with this professional expertise, it was the caring nature and the deeply personal touch that made me feel at home.

Her advice and medication has been extremely beneficial through out the period. Any words of appreciation will be less for the kind of advice, strength and support that she has provided us in all these months. Not only is she an expert in her area but is also very approachable, friendly and patient. She has always been available and responded to all our queries even in the wee hours. She goes an extra mile to understand the problems of her patients and provides the best solution. Dr. Rashmi ensured we were calmed down everytime we panicked. Even during the delivery process she was available at all times and ensured that the baby was delivered safely without causing any risk to the mother or the baby. On 1st of January 2025 we were blessed with a baby girl and we are thankful to Dr.Rashmi as it wouldn't have been possible without her support. we would definitely recommend Dr. Rashmi  to all the future parents to be..and one more thing her hospital staff was very cooperative,friendly and they maintained hygiene!!",

          "text": "I had an exceptional experience during my pregnancy at Atmiya Women’s Hospital, where I welcomed my healthy baby boy! I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Jaimin Zalavadiya. From the very beginning, Dr. Jaimin was not only professional but also very approachable, treating me like a friend throughout my journey. He was responsible and focused on my health, prescribing only the necessary medications without overwhelming me with extras.\n\nThe entire staff at the hospital was friendly and supportive, which made my visits more comfortable. When I went into labor, I felt overwhelmed and started to lose hope, thinking I might need a C-section. However, Dr. Jaimin provided the encouragement and reassurance I needed, making me believe that a normal delivery was possible. His support and expertise truly made all the difference. I am thrilled to say that I had a normal delivery on December 22, 2024, and I am now the proud mother of a beautiful baby boy!\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Jaimin Zalavadiya and Atmiya Women’s Hospital to anyone looking for compassionate and skilled care. In the future, I will definitely choose this hospital and doctor again. Thank you, Dr. Jaimin! 😊",

Thanks to her expertise and the team's attentive support, both mother and baby are in excellent health and recovering beautifully.\n\nThe staff went above and beyond to make sure every detail was taken care of — from regular check-ins to emotional support and a well-managed environment.

The doctors, especially Dr.Bharta sir and Dr. Dushyant sir and his team were knowledgeable, patient, and made us feel completely at ease during such an important time.\n\nThe hospital maintained top-notch hygiene standards, and the nurses provided round-the-clock care with genuine compassion. They ensured both the baby and the mother were comfortable and well taken care of at every step.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the personal attention we received – it never felt like just another case.

Her calm & compassionate approach made us feel at ease during an otherwise very anxious time & we felt safe that mummy was in good hands. It is evident that Dr Aneri treats her patients as human beings first, not just another medical case and provides a very holistic approach to improving their quality of life.\n\nThe team were all outstanding and we received utmost care in the post-operative stages. The attention to detail by every employee is outstanding. Staff were extremely professional & the hospital ambience was just right for recovery & healing. The food served was simple & nutritious and nothing was ever too much trouble for the staff.\n\nShreenath Hospital have managed to create a family business that stands tall based on its values of providing the best care and remaining highly ethical in a competitive environment, where sadly most choose not to. Huge kudos to the management & the entire team for doing a brilliant job and remaining true to their values. Highly recommend.",

Both my sister and I went through a very challenging journey during our deliveries, and I cannot express enough gratitude for Dr. Talati and his incredible team.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped into Eve Hospital, we felt a sense of warmth and professionalism. Dr. Talati impressed us with his expertise, compassion, and unwavering support. He took the time to ensure that we felt comfortable and informed throughout the entire process, which made a world of difference during such a vulnerable time.\nThe entire staff at Eve Hospital contributed to our positive experience. Each member of the team, from those at the reception desk to the nursing staff, demonstrated a level of professionalism and empathy that is truly commendable.\nI genuinely appreciate how the team at Eve Hospital went beyond their roles to support us, both during our pregnancies and after delivery. The follow-up care was exceptional, ensuring that we felt prepared as new parents.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Eve Hospital to anyone seeking maternity care. The support we received was nothing short of miraculous, and I will forever cherish the kindness and expertise of Dr. Talati and his team. Thank you, Eve Hospital, for being there during our most difficult moments and blessing us with two little miracles. Your dedication and compassion will never be forgotten😊😊",

You will never get a typical hospital smell in the entire premise.\n\nA medical store is available at the ground floor and you will get all the medicines there which are being recommended. You don't have to run outside for medicines.\n\nMatrutva Hospital gave us the most precious moment of our life. We got our RUDRITH Baby on 12th May'25.\nDr Rajat and Dr Swapna both were available at the OT and we got two experts during the surgery.\nPost surgery they provided us the best available room at their hospital which had all required amenities. Most Importantly the \"Cleanliness & Hygiene\"\n24x7 Staffs were assigned and they were constantly sitting outside our room, may it be day or night.\nThey were always available with a smile on their face.\n\nI would recommend Matrutva Hospital 200% to everyone who all are expecting parents or wish to become parents.\n\nKudos to Dr Rajat Sir & Dr Sapna Madam for building trust and providing the best in class maternity support to our family.\n\nA big thank you to the entire team of Matrutva Hospital from our little champ - Rudrith Raj Das 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\n\nParents -\nSananda Chowdhury\nRajdeep Das",

The care we received started even before conception, with thorough consultations and guidance from the experienced and compassionate Dr.Rajat kumar. Dr Rajat and Dr.Sapna took the time to answer all our questions, offering peace of mind and ensuring we felt fully prepared every step of the way.\n\nThroughout pregnancy, the hospital's staff made me feel truly cared for. Regular check-ups were always thorough and comforting, with a clear focus on both my well-being and that of my baby. The nurses and doctors went above and beyond to create a warm, welcoming environment—one that felt more like a family than just a medical facility.\n\nThe day of delivery was made much easier by the calm and reassuring atmosphere. The team worked seamlessly, providing the perfect balance of professional expertise and compassionate support. I felt safe, valued, and listened to throughout the entire process. The hospital rooms were comfortable, clean, and designed to feel like a home away from home, ensuring that my experience was as stress-free as possible.\n\nWhat truly sets this matritva hospital apart is the genuine sense of care and attention to detail. From the moment we walked in for our first consultation to the birth of our child, it felt like we were surrounded by a team who truly cared for our family. We are forever grateful for the best care and the homely, nurturing environment they provided, making the birth of our child a beautiful, unforgettable experience.",

          "text": "Incredible and a fantastic experience !\n\nI don't even know where do I begin with ?\nI had an incredible and an amazing experience with Dr. Viral Thekdi throughout my pregnancy and delivery. I was having a very high risk pregnancy due to PIH (Pregnancy Induced Hypertension) which generally leads to health hazards like placental rupture and convulsions. But Dr. Viral handled the situation very calmly, intelligently and with a smile on his face always. The decision making capacity of Dr. Viral along with his diligence and sincereness is something highly appreciable. He was available all the time for me and always kept a track of my blood pressure; he assured his presence in case of any emergency. My baby was very safely delivered by Dr. Viral in the presence of a highly qualified team of anesthetist, a pediatrician and a very supportive and kind squad of nurses and staff of Keshav Hospital.  Honestly speaking Dr. Viral Thekdi has been god to me and my husband. The staff and nurses are highly efficient and well mannered. My journey has been amazing and nothing short of a dream. The temperament, behavior, problem solving ability, listening skills and assurance attribute of Dr. Viral Thekdi is what makes him very special and class apart. Even a zillion of gratitude and thankfulness would be less in front of the experience that I've gained under his supervision. Within 4 days I was well recovered and there was no pain. Not only through pre - delivering; but Dr. Viral also made sure that my post partum healing and improvement falls in to place; keeping in mind to bring down the Blood Pressure after delivery and giving appropriate and correct amount of medicines for my healing journey.\nI am truly blessed to have chosen Dr. Viral Thekdi and Keshav Hospital to be a part of my pregnancy and delivery journey which was indeed magical !",

We had consulted many clinics before this and everyone was suggesting to go for IVF, but we conceived baby without any formal treatment here and are blessed with a baby boy! From planning the baby to conceiving to first trimester and to finally deliver the baby healthy, the staff and Dr were with us at every stage to guide us. I highly recommend to anyone who is planning a baby. Fees are nominal too, and beyond that, it's the right consultation, diagnosis and treatment that matters the most.

          "text": "Our experience at Flowrence Hospital under the care of Dr. Amitaben Bhatt and Dr. Shaival Bhatt was exceptional. As first-time parents, my wife, Smitu, and I were both excited and anxious when we visited the hospital for the first time in March 2024. We had heard that both doctors are outstanding gynecologists, widely recognized in the Saurashtra region, and our experience confirmed this reputation.\n\nFrom the very first visit, Dr. Amitaben Bhatt provided us with invaluable guidance. She explained each stage of the pregnancy in such a caring and clear manner, making us feel at ease and well-prepared. Every time we returned for a check-up, both doctors treated us with warmth and patience, answering our questions with a calm and reassuring approach. Their expertise was especially evident on November 4, 2024, when my wife went into labor early in the morning. The nursing staff greeted us warmly and treated us with the utmost care, which was especially impressive considering it was during Diwali vacation.\n\nDr. Shaival Bhatt was committed to ensuring a safe and healthy delivery. Although we were open to a cesarean if necessary, Dr. Shaival made every effort for a normal delivery and succeeded, much to our gratitude. Following the birth, she provided essential guidance on caring for our newborn and new mother, offering valuable advice with compassion and understanding. The nursing staff was attentive and supportive throughout, always ready to help us with a kind and patient approach.\n\nThe facilities at Flowrence Hospital were excellent, with an on-site laboratory and pediatrician, ensuring everything we needed was available. The staff, from reception to security, were well-trained, courteous, and genuinely caring, which made us feel welcome and comfortable at every step.\n\nDr. Shaival Bhatt and Dr. Amitaben Bhatt’s frequent check-ups after delivery showed their dedication to patient well-being. We left the hospital deeply satisfied, not only with the top-notch care but also with the surprisingly reasonable billing that brought a smile to our faces.\n\nBeing first-time parents can be overwhelming, but the expertise and guidance from both doctors truly relieved our stress. Flowrence Hospital offers premium care at an affordable rate, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking doctors with a genuinely humane approach to patient care. Dr. Amitaben and Dr. Shaival Bhatt’s ethical, compassionate service is a gift to society, and we are grateful to have had them on this journey with us.",

His behavior was completely unprofessional, rude, and disrespectful. Instead of helping or showing care, he created unnecessary stress and discomfort during an already difficult time.\n\nSuch conduct is unacceptable, especially in a place meant for healing and care. Thushar’s attitude gave a very negative impression of the hospital and left us feeling extremely disappointed. Staff members should be trained to handle patients and their families with empathy and respect, but unfortunately, that was not our experience here.\n\nBecause of this incident, we will never recommend Satnam Hospital to anyone. A single staff member’s behavior can damage the trust people place in a hospital, and this experience has done exactly that for us.\n\nWe hope the hospital management takes immediate action to improve their staff's attitude and ensure patients are treated with dignity in the future.",

Dr. Amit Vaja himself being an M.D. Gynec gives an added advantage and his clear, to the point reports help the family as well as the concerned doctor in understanding it. This clinic also lets a family member accompany the patient in the sonography room (which most radiologist & sonographist don't allow), which provides transparency and trustworthiness. I highly recommend this to all the to-be moms & dads.",

During this difficult time, we experienced something very distressing that must be addressed.\n\nThe hospital's ambulance service quoted us ₹100 per km to transport his body to our hometown, Jafrabad (around 160 km one way, 320 km round trip). They demanded ₹32,000, which is an exorbitant amount. We ended up hiring a larger, better-equipped ambulance from outside the hospital, and the total cost was only ₹6,000. This clear difference shows how the hospital is exploiting grieving families.\n\nHospitals should be places of compassion and care, not profit-driven institutions that take advantage of vulnerable people. Sadly, our experience at HCG Bhavnagar felt like the latter.\n\nMoreover, I strongly urge the government to keep an eye on the pricing of hospital services, ambulance charges, medicines, and other essentials. There should be proper regulation to protect common people from such exploitation during already difficult times.\n\nI hope the hospital and the authorities take this feedback seriously and bring necessary reforms so that no other family has to suffer like we did.",

However, thanks to Dr. Parekh’s expertise, support, and confidence, I was able to have a normal delivery this time — something I had really hoped for.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy, the doctor and their staff was attentive, reassuring, and always available to answer any questions or concerns even on phone or what’s app.\n\nOne of the best decisions I made during labor was opting for an epidural, which made my journey much more comfortable and manageable. I’m fully satisfied with the treatment and care I received. I highly recommend Dr. Dipen Parekh to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, skilled, and experienced gynaecologist.",

The nurses and doctors were incredibly supportive, especially when it came to encouraging natural birth, which I truly appreciated. The doctors are also very pro-breastfeeding and do not promote powdered milk, which aligns with the hospital’s commitment to the best care for mothers and babies.\n\nThe hospital strictly follows American guidelines for vaccinations and other important protocols, which gave me peace of mind. The staff were consistently polite, helpful, and professional, and the hospital maintains high standards of hygiene throughout the premises and rooms. I also loved the calming, chill music played in the waiting area, which created a relaxing atmosphere.\n\nI had an emergency at 3 a.m. during a heavy rainstorm, and I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently the hospital responded. The emergency care was prompt and well-handled, making me feel safe and supported during a stressful time.\n\nI highly recommend KK Women’s Hospital to any couple planning to start their family.

The senior and junior doctors (Dr. Dipak and Dr. Anand Bhagde), have both been very genuine in their practices. They don't unnecessarily prescribe you with long list of medicines. Instead, just as much as actually needed.  The team is not business-minded. They do care for the patients. Covid protocols are also maintained even at the labour room. Hygiene standards, especially in the labour room, has also improved considerably. The staff is well-trained under the able guidance of the Doctors. The sub-staff is also very polite and servile.

          "text": "I recently visited a hospital that specializes in both gynaecology and orthopaedics, and I have to say, I was really impressed. The entire experience, from scheduling the appointment to the consultations, was smooth and efficient. I took my wife to see a doctor for some advice. The gynaecologist dr  I saw took the time to answer all my questions without rushing. She made me feel comfortable and really listened to my concerns. You can tell she’s knowledgeable and genuinely cares about her patients.On the orthopaedic side, I had a slight issue with my knee, and the doctor provided a thorough examination. He explained everything in a way that was easy to understand, and I appreciated that he talked me through the treatment options without pushing me into anything.The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the whole process, making the experience even better. The facilities were clean and well-maintained, which always helps ease any worries. Overall, I left feeling well taken care of and confident in the advice I received. If you're looking for good care in either of these specialties, I’d definitely recommend checking this hospital out!",

At last moment they'll not hold your hand..which same thing happened with my sister too..And they have misplaced our file so they could not get in problem because my baby is ill because of there careless behaviour ..please do not visit here there staff have ruined the hospital's image , instead there are best hospital other then this where you're proper taken care of after the delivery where they give vaccine in 24hrs to the baby and explain everything in detail..",

After following her prescribed medication and undergoing treatment, my skin became noticeably smoother and softer—much more than I expected, and I started seeing results in just a few sessions!\n\nThe staff is very welcoming and polite, which made the whole experience even better. Dr. Vinisha herself communicates clearly and professionally, and she explained everything about the treatment in detail, which made me feel confident and comfortable.\n\nThe clinic has a very cozy, clean, and hygienic atmosphere—you instantly feel at ease when you walk in.\n\nI am totally satisfied with both the treatment and consultation. I would absolutely recommend her clinic to anyone looking for genuine and effective skincare solutions. Don’t hesitate—just go!\n\nRating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\n\n---\n\nFeel free to tweak it further if you’d like to add anything personal!",

The doctor and her team was very polite and generous to attend our all the queries. During the pregnancy tenure having personal level support system from the hospital helped us to deal with our emotional journey.\n\nOur baby by the god's grace and support from the hospital team got delivered in the night at 2:00 AM and the team was there to support even at that time. And lastly and most importantly this hospital is budget friendly so for the middle class people like me got best treatment in the budget friendly cost.\n\nI sincerely thanks to Dr. Rujul Mam and her team for making this possible and having my baby in this world. 😇",

I joined Gokul Hospital, Junagadh last month for my delivery, and I couldn't be more satisfied with the care and treatment I received. Dr. Vishal Vaishnani and Dr. Chandani Vaishnani are truly the best—both are experienced, kind, and incredibly supportive throughout the entire process. Their expertise, calm nature, and constant support gave me complete confidence during each visit.\n\nThe hospital is clean, well-maintained. The entire staff—from nurses to support team—was kind, helpful, and attentive to every need, especially during labor and post-delivery recovery.\n\nDr. Chandani Vaishnani was very encouraging and comforting during my delivery, and Dr. Vishal Vaishnani made sure that every check-up was thorough and informative.",

After 2-3 hours again the Dr. took her to operation theatre and again they opened the stitches of C section done on the same day without any reports and no medical guidance was given to the patient and the family members but after the 2nd operation also the condition was same Dr. was unable to find out what went wrong with the patient after that the condition of the patient became worst and heart beat increases to 160 (bpm) and Dr. told us to take the patient to other hospital and at last he advised us to move to other city as the condition of the patient was very very critical.\nLuckily by God's grace the patient is saved by other doctors but please it's a request 🙏 if u want to save ur near and dear ones DO NOT VISIT this unexperienced Dr. 🙏🙏",

The doctors were highly knowledgeable and took the time to listen to my concerns, providing clear explanations and making me feel at ease.\n\nI underwent a procedure at the hospital, and the entire process was smooth and well-organized. The nursing staff was attentive and caring, ensuring I was comfortable throughout my stay. I was impressed by the hospital's commitment to patient care and the overall positive atmosphere.\n\nI would highly recommend Motherhood Hospital's gynecology department to anyone seeking quality care in a welcoming environment.",

My wife, Pinal, had a mildly complicated cesarean section, but thanks to the skilled, gentle care from Dr. Shruti, Dr. Kuldeep, and the entire team, everything went smoothly, and our son arrived safe and healthy.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, the staff at Famcare made us feel completely at home. Their warmth, friendliness, and genuine care made such a difference – it felt like being with family rather than in a hospital. Dr. Kuldeep and Dr. Shruti created an atmosphere of trust and comfort, which truly eased our minds during such an important moment.\n\nEvery step of the journey, from initial visits to delivery and recovery, was filled with both professionalism and a personal touch that made us feel cared for on every level. For anyone looking for excellent medical care in a setting that feels like home, I highly recommend Famcare Hospital. Thank you, Famcare, for filling this special experience with so much warmth and kindness!",

          "text": "My wife recently delivered my baby at Pankti Hospital, Sargasan, Gandhinagar, and we had an absolutely wonderful experience! From the moment she was starting treatment from first day to admitted until discharge, every staff member—from the nurses to the doctors—was incredibly kind, caring, and supportive. The doctors were highly professional and ensured she was comfortable and well-informed throughout her maternity journey. The nursing staff was equally amazing—always attentive, patient, and ready to help with a smile. I felt genuinely cared for every step of the way. I am so grateful to the entire team for making this such a smooth and positive experience. Highly recommended to any expecting parent..!!",

First of all we had visited with Dr Parmar and he had talked with us very nicely & give us proper time to understand the disease. Then they give us appointment for operation. While we attended that day we don’t feel that we are in Hospital cause the staff was very cooperative & hygiene of hospital was too good. Also we noticed that Dr. Parmar Sir was very cooperative as they really take care of patients till they give proper results of disease.

He explained each and every step in detail and made me  comfortable throughout the pregnancy. Sometimes, gynecologists tell the women to suck it up during their pregnancy and not listen to their difficulties, small or big. But Dr. Darshan did not dismiss any of my concerns as a routine matter and always addressed them with utmost care. He's truly a \"girls' girl\".\n\nShout out to all the nurses at the hospital too. Especially nurse Heena, who was super competent and sweet & nurse Sarita who took excellent care of our newborn.",

          "text": "*Updated Response*\n\n1.\tStaffing Violations: Your hospital lacks the essential staff required under medical regulatory norms. There were no trained professionals present at critical times, and more shockingly, even the basic support staff were missing during key moments of my treatment. This alone is a grave violation of healthcare standards.\n\n2.\tAbsence During Emergency: On a crucial night, when I approached your hospital seeking urgent delivery-related assistance, neither the doctor nor any responsible staff member was available. This abandonment during a potential medical emergency speaks volumes about your institution’s unreliability and lack of readiness.\n\n3.\tFalse Claim About Bills: You brazenly stated that bills were provided, which is absolutely false. I openly challenge you to publish the said bills on this same platform if you truly believe your claim. I have documented proof, including a message from your hospital explicitly stating that “you will not be given a bill for a miscarriage.” This is not just unethical—it is unlawful. If you fail to either produce the bills or issue a public apology, I will be left with no choice but to pursue legal action. I am fully prepared to take this matter to court and let the judiciary evaluate your conduct.\n\n4.\tBreach of Confidentiality & Defamation: Referring to my profession and disclosing alleged private conversations with my husband is a blatant breach of doctor-patient confidentiality. It’s disgraceful that instead of addressing the concerns, you chose to engage in character assassination.\n\n5.\tInsensitive and Superstitious Justifications: Blaming “bad luck” for medical outcomes and branding patients as “not worthy” of your treatment exposes your hospital’s elitist and discriminatory mindset. No medical professional has the right to demean patients who raise legitimate concerns about their care.\n\n6.\tLack of Basic Post-Abortion Care: During my abortion, no sanitary kit, gown, or even basic hygiene protocols were followed. This isn’t just neglect—it’s a violation of every standard operating procedure in women’s healthcare.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nMy experience with this gynecologist was very horrible.\nThis was my most painful check up ever.\nThe hospital failed to provide medical bills and treatment documents\nWhen we asked for the bill, Dr. Darsan said that you should have said first that you want the bill, now you will not get the bill for the miscarigae\nThey were not ready to give me any bill for any injection and also created false obstacles\nThey did not provide any\ntype of kit and clothes during my abortion\nI have not seen any woman delivery during 3 months, and I have not seen any pregnant woman who has passed 7 to 8 months.\nAvoid this hospital at all costs!",

Personally, we have never faced any issues with her.\n5) She is always punctual. And it is very helpful point when we are in hurry to checkup.\n6) This clinic does not provide 24-hour services. I believe the doctor should give her contact card to patients so they can reach her during emergencies. Normally, we don’t always know when we might need to take our children to the hospital.\n7) Her advice has always worked well for us.\n\nThese are my personal views, which may differ from others, of course.\n\nThank you 🙏🏻",

From diagnosing extra health issues which I wasn't aware of to addressing my current health issues which brought me to the hospital, the staff treated me with care and every process was smooth and efficient. I was updated with everything and felt confident that I have the best people looking out for my health. My surgeries went well and recieved good advice for recovery. I was provided with a great private room before and after surgery as I could not go home straight away. Thanks to Dr. Sanjay, Dr. Tarun.",

Unfortunately, our experience with the hospital’s management was quite disappointing. The biggest issue lies with their receptionist and appointment system. You simply cannot meet Dr. Nimesh unless you take an appointment 2–3 days in advance. Even in urgent situations concerning women’s health, they are completely inflexible and uncooperative.\n\nIf you try to visit for any personal or urgent discussion, they outright reject your request and ask you to come back after a few days. This kind of rigid system is not at all suitable for someone needing immediate medical advice from a trusted doctor. We were highly disappointed with the hospital's management and scheduling process. No complaints about Dr. Nimesh himself—he’s a great doctor—but the way the hospital handles appointments really lets patients down.",
